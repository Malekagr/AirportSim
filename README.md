# AirportSim

 * Malek Ameli-Grillon 
 * Airport simulation
 * 
 * Create a simulation of an airport to model a passengers journey from entering the airport to boarding the plane.
 * Goal: Determining how the airport's revenue and is changed by manipulating the number of check in and security counters, 
 *  in addition to how the passengers path through the airport changes.
 *  
 *  How to run: compile and run code. You will be prompted to enter a number of days. Keep it within the native int size, or else you will have to re-enter a different number. 
 *  Afterwards you will be prompted to enter the number of first class desks and the number of commuter class desks (these can only total to 6). 
 *  The simulation will run and print a list of stats to the terminal
